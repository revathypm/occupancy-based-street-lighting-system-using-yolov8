Occupancy-based street lighting is a product innovation that optimizes urban lighting systems.
Using  a machine learning algorithm and ldr sensor, it detects vehicles and human presence and illuminates streets and public spaces accordingly.
This technology not only conserves energy, reducing operational costs and environmental impact, but also enhances safety by ensuring well-lit pathways.
